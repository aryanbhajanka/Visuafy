Visuafy is a flask based visualiser and remote for Spotify.  
Please note that for the program to work, you would require your own Spotify client ID and secret.  
To do so,  
- open https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/ , sign in and create an app.  
- Click on 'Edit Settings' and set 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/' as a redirect URI.  
- Finally, paste your Spotify client ID and secret on line 14 and 15 of main.py
